				'<p>Bright orange denim: exactly what any self-respecting military man would want to wear when charging into combat. Nothing screams “Ready for War!” like bright orange.
				<p>No. Orange is what you would wear when you’re screaming “hey! Shoot me!”
				<p>This was something that always bothered me. Why was the “Combat Suit” designed to look like something an underpaid construction worker would wear when he went off to his day job. I did not think this seemed right, so I set off to fix the problem.
				<p>I took the unused flight-suit model and skinned it to create a functional-looking suit designed for combat. I hoped to create something to fit that title, and I do believe this is the best thing I could make to remedy that situation.
				<p>This mod also comes with a skin if the original model to replace the light combat suit armor. This had been also designed to the same specifications as the regular combat suit.
				<p>This mod fixes something that really bugged me about these games and I hope you enjoy my effort.',

Sounds pretty scary, doesn’t it? But have you played the game? It’s not scary in the slightest. The circumstance’s effect is lessened by the atmosphere that has been poorly designed for a horror-themed level.
				<p>I set out to achieve the atmosphere I felt this place needed. I darkened the entire environment to the point where it’s almost impossible to see at times, and replaced the music to an ominous sounding track to really build the atmosphere.
				<p>I set out to achieve a frightening environment, and I do believe I succeeded. Give it a download and try it out.',
